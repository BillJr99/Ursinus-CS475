title: "CS475: Computer Networks - Security and Privacy"


info:
  goals: 
    - To explain the need for security and privacy protocols since these were not built into the Internet originally
    - To describe the functionality of protocols used to implement authentication, authorization, non-repudiation
    - To explain the role of cryptography in security and privacy, as well as its underlying algorithms
    - To explain and execute the process for public-key cryptography
    - To explain how public key cryptography is used to generate a digital signature that enforces non-repudiation

      title: Public-Key Cryptography
      questions:
        - Choose a secret numeric value that you want to send securely to a partner.
        - Fill in the nodes of the public map with integers that add up to the secret value you chose.
        - For each node, replace the value with the sum of itself plus the original value found in the adjacent neighbors.
        - Send this graph to your partner.  Can your partner figure out the value without any help (probably not!)?
        - Your partner (and only your partner) should look at the Private Map (see below), which highlights the nodes that should be added together to obtain the value.
        - How did this work?  If every student used a unique "map," how could you use this approach to send data securely to anyone?

      title: Digital Signatures
      questions:
        - If I encrypt something using someone's private map, who can decode it?
        - If I encrypt something using my own public map, who can decode it?
        - How could you use these maps to ensure that a particular person actually sent a particular value?
        - How can I use this approach to ensure that the data that I sent was not altered along the way?

      questions:
        - What is an SSL Certificate Chain?
        - What is a Certificate Authority?
        - "Using this command, generate and use your own SSL certificate: <code>openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem && openssl req -new -key private_key.pem -out csr.pem && openssl x509 -req -days 9999 -in csr.pem -signkey private_key.pem -out certificate_chain.pem</code>.  Add these to a node.js program and invoke an endpoint over https."
        - Did you get a warning from your browser and, if so, why?

      title: Signing of a Public Key by a Certificate Authority
      questions:
        - Although you can self-sign a certificate, why might it be more authoritative to have a trusted third party validate your identity and sign your key to form a certificate?

      questions:
        - Is the public/private key from the SSL certificate actually used to encrypt data between the client and server?  Why or why not?  If not, what is used instead?

      title: "Transport Layer Security (TLS)"
      questions: 
        - "How do the two peers agree upon the cipher algorithm to use?"
        - "How do the two peers exchange their keys?  How can they exchange keys securely?"
        - "How might we prevent someone from re-ordering our encrypted packets, or from observing encrypted traffic and &quot;replaying&quot; it by resubmitting the traffic on our behalf?"

      title: "IPSec for Virtual Private Networks (VPN)"
      questions: 
        - "What is the difference between using IPSec in Transport mode as opposed to Tunnel mode?"
        - "Why might a tunnel be used in conjunction with an encrypted connection to provide Virtual Private Networking?  Note that this is sometimes implemented with the Layer 2 Transport Protocol (L2TP) over IPSec"

      title: "Firewalls"

        - "What are some sensible rules to block traffic, except that traffic originated by you, or incoming traffic to certain applications?"
        - "What would you do if you wanted to allow an exception to these rules for a particular connection?"
