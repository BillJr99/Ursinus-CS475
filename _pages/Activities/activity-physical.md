      title: "Communication over a Shared Medium"
      questions: 
        - "How might you ensure that only one person speaks at a time?"      
        - "How do we know if a message is destined for us as opposed to someone else?  What information would we need, and at what layer would we find it?"
        - "At what point would you determine that your message was corrupted due to a collision?  What would you do about it?"
        - "Hubs are essentially repeater devices that echo the data from one sender to all ports on the hub.  Why is this inefficient, and what could we do about it?"
        - "Hubs even echo a packet back to the sender: why is this useful for collision detection purposes?  Draw a diagram showing that a collision can occur even if two senders begin transmission on a clear line."
        - "We transmit data using bits, which are either 1 (on) or 0 (off).  You can imagine this as a tone that is either on or off.  Why can't we simply set the voltage or tone to high to transmit a 1, or simply turn it low or off to transmit a 0?"

      title: "One Approach to Multiple Access: Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA): The ALOHA Protocol"
      questions: 
        - "In Pure ALOHA, those who wish to transmit do so without checking if the medium is clear.  Collisions can happen at any time.  If a collision occurs, the nodes back off for a random period of time.  If any part of a transmission is corrupted, the whole frame is discarded; therefore, for how long is the transmission of two packets of size T vulnerable to collision with one another?"        
        - "What is the difference between Pure ALOHA and Slotted ALOHA?  What is the vulnerable time period for two packets of size T using Slotted ALOHA?  Which is more efficient?"

        <div align="left">
        The probability of <code>x</code> nodes transmitting a frame at the beginning of a Slotted ALOHA frame, when assuming that, on average, nodes transmit with probability <code>G</code>, is defined by a Poisson Distribution (an asymptotic extension of the Binomial Distribution): <span>\(P(x) = \frac{G^{x} e^{-nG}}{x!}\)</span>, where <code>n</code> is 1 for slotted ALOHA, and 2 for ALOHA.  
        </div>
      title: "ALOHA Transmission Efficiency"
      questions: 
        - "Why do you think <code>n = 2</code> for pure ALOHA in the formula above?"
        - "What is <code>P(1)</code>, the probability that exactly one node will transmit in a frame using Slotted ALOHA?"
        - "In unslotted ALOHA, we must assume that only one node transmits during a specific frame, and also that no node transmits during the prior frame, to avoid a collision.  These are independent events, so the unslotted probability is <code>P = P(1) P(0)</code>.  What is this, and how does it relate to the Slotted ALOHA probability of successful transmission?"
        - "Take the derivative of the probability function for slotted ALOHA and for unslotted ALOHA with respect to <code>G</code>, and set it equal to 0 to maximize the function.  Let <code>x</code> be a constant 1 for a single transmit node.  At what value of <code>G</code> is each maximized?  Plug in this value and set <code>x</code> equal to 1 to observe the maximum transmission efficiency.  Hint: use the product rule!"

      title: "Communicating a bit via the Ethernet Standard IEEE 802.3"
      questions: 
        - "In your own words, how is a 0 or a 1 represented by 802.3 Manchester Encoding?"
        - "Look at a vew values of the 802.3 Manchester encoding, the data, and the clock.  Write down a few sample values at a few snapshots in time.  What binary expression might relate the data and clock to the Manchester encoding?"

      questions: 
        - "What are some ways an Ethernet cable can be multiplexed to support faster throughput (or more &quot;lanes&quot;)?" 
        - "What do you think are the speed limiting factors for throughput on an Ethernet cable?"
        - "In a twisted-pair cable such as CAT5e or CAT6 Ethernet, there are two cables for each Ethernet connector pin (each of these pins has a pin connector and a ring connector).  How might differential voltages on these lines be used to identify a 1 or a 0 bit?"
        - "Do you think thicker copper wire can support higher frequency RF oscillations?  What effect would this have on throughput?"

      questions: 
        - "What is a Walsh Matrix?"        
        - "A spreading sequence <code>v</code> is computed from each node's chip code such that each 1 in the vector remains a 1, and each 0 becomes a -1.  Why do you think this is done?"
        - "Each node transmits <code>v</code> for a 1 and <code>-v</code> for a 0 bit.  What do you think is transmitted if no data is intended to be sent on the medium?"
        - "What would happen if one takes the dot product of a received vector with a sender's spreading code?  How might this change if there is interference due to simultaneous transmissions on the line?  Specifically, what is the most important attribute of each value in the resulting vector of the dot product to determine what corresponding bit was transmitted (hint: it's not the magnitude of the value itself!)?"
        - "How is constructive interference used to encode and, thus, to extract data from a shared medium when collisions occur between senders?"
        - "What sacrifice was made to enable this spread-spectrum technique?"
