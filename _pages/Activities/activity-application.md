      title: "HTTP"
      questions: 
        - "If a web page contained an image, what would need to happen?  How might this be optimized?  Hint: this optimization is implemented in HTTP/1.1"
        - "What information could be stored to maintain state between requests; that is, to associate a request with a particular user or session?  Why isn't a stateful session mechanism built into HTTP?"
        - "Look up a few HTTP response code numbers.  What pattern do you see?"
        - "What are some HTTP client headers and what do they do?"
        - "How do you upload a file via HTTP?"
        - "Since socket I/O is typically a blocking call, how can you know how much data to read from the socket so that you don't block forever waiting for data that never arrives?"
        - "How do you know when you are finished sending or receiving headers?  How do you parse each header?  How do you know when HTTP (or web page) data begins and ends?"

      title: "SMTP"
      questions: 
        - "How does a mail client indicate to the server that they are finished sending a message?  What if the sender wishes to transmit that character?"
        - "How might a sender authenticate against the server?"
        - "Where does the sender indicate their email address?  What unfortunate consequence could result from this?"
        - "How might a sender attach a file?"
        - "What might you do if you were sending non-text, like an MP3 file, over a text-based protocol like this one?"
